# Tasks 

* Add front end functionality to allow users to follow/unfollow each other :: how will they be accessible to each other? Search usernames? ID? 

* Implement global feed. Users can add climbs to feed. They will display in chronological order. Maybe give users a way to interact with them.

* Design a front end for History - Sessions are being displayed no problem, layout is hideous though. Should be a grid or something. 

* A page that generates and displays statistics based on sessions
